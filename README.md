## 1. Defne each of the 4 T's of Prompt Engineering

- Traits:
Traits are short instructions on how you want the LLM to engage with you. I would consider "role" and "audience" as the most basic traits. Some LLM has build in support for defining these. In gpt we can set the audience in "who are you" under "customize gtp". Examples could be: Giving a role to the LLM such as a teacher or student. Giving the LLM clues about the intended audience can also help. For example one could instruct the LLM to tailor the content to a middle school student, a highschool student or a college student. Traits are broader then just Role and Audience, and can sometimes overlap with the other t's. For example, in GPT the user can give traits about "tone", and "format"(be chatty, answer in only list format). 

- Tasks:
This is where we formulate what we want the LLM to achieve. The central part will usually take the form of a specific task such as (summarize, write, analyse, translate, order). There are a few different rules and guidelines on how to formulate the tasks in different scenarios. I will go over a handlfull of the most important ones i the following:
    - dw
    - dwd
